# Hartje Parking Platform


## Approach
- Since each vehicle has a unique license plate, I used the license plate as the primary key for the vehicle.

# Backend API Improvements
- The occupancy value should be non-negative integer.
- Provide the error codes and messages for the API responses.
- Parking spaces description does not correlate with the actual data
